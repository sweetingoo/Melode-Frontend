# Cursor Rules for Melode Frontend

## Project Context
This is a Next.js frontend application for the Melode project. The codebase uses React, Next.js, and modern JavaScript/JSX patterns.

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow existing code patterns and structure
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components)
- Prefer explicit imports over default imports when possible
- Use British English spelling: use 's' instead of 'z' (e.g., "organise" not "organize", "customise" not "customize")

## File Organization
- Components go in `/components`
- Hooks go in `/hooks`
- Services/API clients go in `/services`
- Utilities go in `/utils`
- Pages/routes go in `/app` following Next.js App Router structure

## Documentation
- **NEVER create documentation files unless explicitly asked by the user**
- Do not create README files, markdown files, or any documentation unless the user specifically requests it
- Do not proactively create documentation even if it seems helpful
- Only create documentation files when the user explicitly asks for them
- Focus on code implementation rather than documentation

## Database & Migrations
- Do not create migrations manually
- Let the backend handle database migrations
- Use --autogenerate. The DATABASE_URL is already in .env

## Testing
- Maintain existing test patterns
- Tests are located in `__tests__` directory
- Use Jest for unit tests and Playwright for E2E tests

## Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing error handling patterns
- Use TypeScript-style JSDoc comments when helpful
- Ensure code is properly formatted and linted

## API Integration
- Use the existing API client patterns in `/services`
- Follow the established authentication and token management patterns
- Handle errors gracefully using existing error handling utilities
- **ALWAYS use slugs (strings) instead of IDs (integers) for all API path parameters**
- Use `entitySlug`, `userSlug`, `taskSlug`, `projectSlug`, etc. for path parameters
- Request bodies and query parameters may still use IDs where appropriate (as per migration guide)
- When working with entities, always pass `slug` values to API endpoints, not `id` values
